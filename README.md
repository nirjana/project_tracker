# Project Management
## Description
Project Management
✅ Successfully implemented two models: Project (title, description) and Task (title, status, projectId).
✅ Created basic CRUD API endpoints for both models with input validation and enum constraints for task status.
✅ Developed a React frontend with project and task list views, task creation, and status updates via dropdown.
✅ UI updates dynamically after actions, with no page reload required — keeping the UX clean and responsive.
